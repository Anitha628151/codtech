Task-1: Create a Python program that acts as a basic calculator. It should prompt the user to
enter two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division). Then, it should perform the selected operation and display the result to the
user.
Objective: To develop a Python program that functions as a basic calculator, allowing users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations. The program will prompt users to enter two numerical values and choose an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). Upon receiving the input, the program will execute the selected operation and display the result to the user. This calculator will include basic error handling to manage invalid inputs and division by zero scenarios.
Overview: This project involves creating a basic calculator program in Python. The program will interact with the user through the command line, prompting them to enter two numbers and choose an arithmetic operation to perform. The supported operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. After receiving the user's inputs, the program will execute the chosen operation and display the result. This project also includes basic error handling to ensure the program can gracefully manage incorrect inputs and division by zero
Conclusion: The development of a basic calculator program in Python effectively demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as user input handling, conditional statements, and error management. This project prompts users to enter two numerical values and select an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). It then performs the chosen operation and displays the result. The program is designed with basic error handling to manage invalid inputs and division by zero scenarios, ensuring a robust user experience.
