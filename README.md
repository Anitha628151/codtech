Task-1: Create a Python program that acts as a basic calculator. It should prompt the user to
enter two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division). Then, it should perform the selected operation and display the result to the
user.
Objective: To develop a Python program that functions as a basic calculator, allowing users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations. The program will prompt users to enter two numerical values and choose an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). Upon receiving the input, the program will execute the selected operation and display the result to the user. This calculator will include basic error handling to manage invalid inputs and division by zero scenarios.
Overview: This project involves creating a basic calculator program in Python. The program will interact with the user through the command line, prompting them to enter two numbers and choose an arithmetic operation to perform. The supported operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. After receiving the user's inputs, the program will execute the chosen operation and display the result. This project also includes basic error handling to ensure the program can gracefully manage incorrect inputs and division by zero
Conclusion: The development of a basic calculator program in Python effectively demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as user input handling, conditional statements, and error management. This project prompts users to enter two numerical values and select an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). It then performs the chosen operation and displays the result. The program is designed with basic error handling to manage invalid inputs and division by zero scenarios, ensuring a robust user experience.


Task-2: To develop a Python program to track and manage student grades, we'll create a system that allows users to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall grade along with additional information such as the letter grade or GPA. Below is the code for the program along with a step-by-step explanation.
objective:The objective of this project is to develop a Python program that efficiently tracks and manages student grades. The program will allow users to input grades for various subjects or assignments, compute the average grade, and display the overall performance. This includes calculating and displaying additional information such as the corresponding letter grade and GPA. The system aims to provide a user-friendly interface for grade entry and an accurate, comprehensive summary of student performance, facilitating better academic tracking and management.
overview:This project aims to develop a Python program for tracking and managing student grades. The program will enable users to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall performance of the student. Additionally, the program will provide supplementary information such as the corresponding letter grade and GPA. The system is designed to offer a user-friendly interface for entering grades and deliver an accurate and comprehensive summary of student performance, enhancing academic tracking and management.
conclusion:Developing a Python program to track and manage student grades successfully fulfills the need for an efficient, user-friendly system for academic performance monitoring. By allowing users to input grades for various subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall performance with additional information such as letter grades and GPA, the program provides a comprehensive overview of a student's academic standing. This project demonstrates key programming concepts, including user input handling, arithmetic calculations, and conditionals, while offering a practical tool for educational purposes. The program enhances the ability to track and manage student grades effectively, contributing to better academic planning and decision-making.
